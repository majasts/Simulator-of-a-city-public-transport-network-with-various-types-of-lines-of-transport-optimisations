# Simulator of a City Public Transport Network with Various Types of Lines and Transport Optimizations

## Overview

This project is a C++ OOP based simulation of an urban public transport network, designed to handle transit lines and optimize their operations. It accepts input data detailing bus stops and their corresponding lines, enabling the modeling of complex transit systems. The simulator employs Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently determine the shortest path between two specified stops, facilitating effective route planning and analysis.
